##         Analysis on Avocado Data set
It is a well-known fact that Millennia ls LOVE Avocado Toast. It's also a well-known fact that all Millennial live in their parents' basements. Clearly, they are not buying home because they are buying too much Avocado Toast! They spend nearly dollar 900,000 per month on it, according to data from payment company Square, as reported by Time. Avocado toast sales are also rising quickly. In June 2014, Americans were only buying dollar 17,000 worth of the breakfast per month, compared to dollar 890,500 in June 2017.But maybe there's hopeâ€¦ if a Millenial could find a city with cheap avocados, they could live out the Millenial American Dream.
